h2. Objective-C Rubyfication Project

Objective-C is a great language and Cocoa provides a great set of tools. But if
you are like me and came from Ruby, you will miss lots of things. Some things
can be achieved in Obj-C but with added verbosity.

But, Obj-C has features such as Blocks, Categories, Selectors, Variable length
arguments list for methods, and this allow us to emulate much of the Ruby
standard libraries and syntax to Obj-C.

To make it even more Ruby-like I am using "Kiwi":http://www.kiwi-lib.info/ which is a RSpec-like library
for unit testing. It is far easier to use than SenTesting alone.

The idea is to implement Categories to add features to existing Obj-C classes
such as NSString and NSArray.

If all goes well, the second step is to implement ActiveSupport and add stuff
like:

<pre><code>
[[theValue(1) day] ago];
</code></pre>

Or, who knows, even:

<pre><code>
[@"octopus" pluralize];
</code></pre>

Feel free to add new features and let me know if this is useful or not, right
now I am doing this just for the fun of it.
